// A class for fuzz executions with Intel PT
// NOTE:
// This executor provides path coverage feedback introduced in PTrix (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10499.pdf).
// The original PTrix implementation uses two bitmaps: trace_bits and pt_fav_bits.
// trace_bits records the last TIP IP hash value in the current context represented as one bit.
// This trace_bits semantics is quite different from the traditional AFL edge coverage, so we cannot use the trace_bits for calculating top_rated[] on AFL.
// The PTrix implementation introduces pt_fav_bits to calculate top_rated[].
// From the above reasons, we should consider renaming trace_bits so that fuzzers can distinguish the shared memory semantics.
